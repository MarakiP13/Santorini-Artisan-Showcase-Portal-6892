      'For millennia, the Cycladic islands have been home to a rich tradition of pottery making. The distinctive white clay of Santorini, enriched by volcanic minerals, has given local ceramics their unique character.',
      'Today\'s artisans, like Maria Nikolaou, are breathing new life into these ancient techniques. Working from her sun-drenched studio in Oia, Maria combines traditional methods with contemporary designs, creating pieces that bridge past and present.',
      'The process begins with locally sourced clay, carefully prepared using methods passed down through generations. Each piece is hand-thrown on a traditional wheel, allowing the artist to feel the material\'s response and adjust their technique accordingly.',
      'What makes Cycladic pottery unique is not just its methods, but the stories it tells. Every vessel, every pattern, speaks to the history of these islands and the people who have called them home.'
